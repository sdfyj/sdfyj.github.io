<p>I am very happy to be able to live in this era, witnessing the rapid development of the motherland and the continuous
improvement of the living standards of the people.
Memories of my childhood life, the river, constantly flowing all the year around, was near by my home. In midsummer, I always played by the river, cuted off the water, catched small fish and played with tadpoles. For there were several willow trees by the river, we often climbed up and down barefoot, made crowns out of wicker, slingshots out of branches, and stuck cicada with flour. In the evening, listened to the sound of frogs, very lively. I&rsquo;ve also played earth-pushing, mud-mixing, rubber band skipping, glass beads, snowman-making, playing house, hide-and-seek with my friends. Hoeing, fertilizing, loosening soil, picking corn, cutting wheat, peeling corn grains, planting sweet potatoes, planting trees, planting peanuts and other farm work has been done.
In summer, when I finished farm work, my mouth parched and tongue scorched; when drinking water and eating a popsicle, brimming with happiness all over the face; when I went back home so hungry that the stomach was beginning to gurgle and ate a steamed bread steamed by my grandmother, my mouth was full of sweetness, which be still fresh in my memory. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t know what PHS, pager, celluar phone and computer were. Just know if I can watch Calabash Brothers on a black-and-white TV, Soccer Boy, Slam Dunk, Journey to the West on a color TV, don&rsquo;t mention how happy I was then.
Later in the third grade of primary school, the school opened a computer course, with the first batch of computers which were DOS system. Before every class, we should wear shoes and wash our hands because we were worried that computers might be infected with viruses. The most we played was to see who typed fast and grabbed music games.
In junior middle school, I began to contact with English, learned a little programming, and participated in computer drawing competitions.
In high school, &ldquo;intoxicated&rdquo; in learning, did not care what was going on outside the window, and was envious to see my classmates playing with X86 desktop computers at home, carrying MP3 with them and using mobile phones. I was surprised to find that MP3 could even store files printed in print shops, which was subverting my perception.
In college, I began to have my own mobile phones which buyed by my parents, began to contact the world through mobile phones, play the Xiaonei. But in less than a year, the mobile phone was stolen. I was so sad that tried to weep, but failed to shed a tear. From then on, I hated thieves.
At the begining of my sophomore year, the college allowed we to take a computer. I started to use my eldest brother&rsquo;s
IBM notebook computer. I found that operation of the computer was so interesting and that it was so versatile.
At that time, I felt great to install a system by myself, but it did not trigger more enlightenment.
When I came to Beijing as a graduate student, felt the fast-paced life and met many excellent people. Thanks to the school environment, I began to learn R language and realized the charm of statistics and I had little talent and less learning.
After work,I began to contact Python for financial data processing and learn Mysql, Oracle database and manage code through git.
In 2016, I really owned my first laptop Macbook Pro and started new experience.
In this process, I have gradually defined the direction I am interested in, be a person who knows a lot about
computer programming, statistics and financial investment. Now that I have found the direction, the next step is to continue to conduct in-depth research and practice in the field of financial investment on the basis of statistical
theory and computer tools.
The reason for establishing this website is also to urge myself to study systematically, record bit by bit, have a
sense of ceremony, at the same time, facilitate myself to inquire and share knowlege. Today is May 21, 2019.</p>
